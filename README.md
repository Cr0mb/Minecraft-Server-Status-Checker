# Minecraft-Server-Status-Checker
This Python script allows you to check the status of Minecraft servers (both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition) using the MCSrvStatus API. It provides information such as server version, player count, MOTD (Message of the Day), plugins, and mods if available. The script also supports an option to exit gracefully.
